# Change Password Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a secure change password feature using Clerk's authentication system. Users can update their passwords through a dedicated screen accessible from the Account Settings page.

**Important Note**: This feature is only available for users who have password-based authentication enabled. Users who signed up through OAuth providers (Google, Apple, etc.) and don't have a password set cannot change their passwords through this app as their passwords are managed by their OAuth provider.

## Implementation Details

### Change Password Screen (`app/(auth)/change-password.tsx`)

The change password screen provides a secure way for users to update their passwords with the following features:

- **Current Password Verification**: Users must enter their current password
- **New Password Requirements**: Enforces strong password policies
- **Password Confirmation**: Requires users to confirm their new password
- **Real-time Validation**: Provides immediate feedback on password strength
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various scenarios

### Password Requirements

The system enforces the following password requirements:

- Minimum 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one number
- Must be different from the current password
- Must not be a compromised password (checked via Clerk's security features)

### Security Features

1. **Clerk Integration**: Uses Clerk's built-in password update functionality
2. **Current Password Verification**: Validates the current password before allowing changes
3. **Password Strength Validation**: Enforces strong password policies
4. **Compromised Password Detection**: Clerk automatically checks against known compromised passwords
5. **Secure Transmission**: All password data is transmitted securely through Clerk's API

### User Flow

#### For Password-Based Users:

1. **Access**: User navigates to Account Settings â†’ Change Password
2. **Current Password**: User enters their current password
3. **New Password**: User enters a new password that meets requirements
4. **Confirmation**: User confirms the new password
5. **Validation**: System validates all inputs and password strength
6. **Update**: If validation passes, password is updated via Clerk
7. **Success**: User receives confirmation and is redirected back

#### For OAuth-Only Users:

1. **Access**: User navigates to Account Settings
2. **Information Display**: User sees informational message about password management
3. **Guidance**: User is informed to change password through their OAuth provider

### Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- **Empty Fields**: Validates that all required fields are filled
- **Weak Passwords**: Checks password strength requirements
- **Password Mismatch**: Ensures new password and confirmation match
- **Same Password**: Prevents users from setting the same password
- **Incorrect Current Password**: Validates current password accuracy
- **Compromised Password**: Warns about known compromised passwords
- **Network Errors**: Handles connection and API errors gracefully

### Integration with Account Settings

The change password feature is integrated into the existing Account Settings page:

- **Conditional Display**: Only shows for users with password-based authentication
- **OAuth User Handling**: Shows informational message for OAuth-only users
- **Password Detection**: Uses `user.passwordEnabled` to determine if user can change password
- **Navigation**: Added "Change Password" option in Account Actions section
- **Consistent UI**: Matches the existing design system and color scheme
- **Icon**: Uses lock-closed-outline icon for visual consistency
- **Description**: Clear description of the feature's purpose

### Testing

Comprehensive tests are included in `__tests__/changePassword.test.tsx` covering:

- Component rendering
- Form validation
- Password strength requirements
- Password confirmation matching
- Error message display
- User interaction flows

### Clerk API Usage

The implementation uses Clerk's `updatePassword` method:

```typescript
await user.updatePassword({
	currentPassword: form.currentPassword,
	newPassword: form.newPassword,
});
```

This method:

- Validates the current password
- Checks password strength requirements
- Updates the password securely
- Handles all error scenarios automatically

### Accessibility

The change password screen includes:

- **Clear Labels**: Descriptive labels for all form fields
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during password updates
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Proper tab order and focus management
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic markup for accessibility tools

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the change password feature:

1. **Password Strength Indicator**: Visual strength meter for new passwords
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Require 2FA verification for password changes
3. **Email Notification**: Send confirmation email when password is changed
4. **Password History**: Prevent reuse of recent passwords
5. **Session Management**: Option to sign out all other sessions after password change

## Usage

### For Password-Based Users:

To change a password:

1. Navigate to Account Settings
2. Tap "Change Password" in the Account Actions section
3. Enter your current password
4. Enter a new password that meets the requirements
5. Confirm the new password
6. Tap "Update Password"
7. Confirm the success message

### For OAuth-Only Users:

OAuth users will see an informational message in Account Settings explaining that password changes are managed through their OAuth provider (Google, Apple, etc.).

## Security Considerations

- All password operations are handled by Clerk's secure API
- Current password verification prevents unauthorized changes
- Strong password requirements reduce security risks
- Compromised password detection prevents weak password usage
- No password data is stored locally or in custom databases
- OAuth users are properly excluded from password change functionality
- Clear messaging guides OAuth users to their provider for password management

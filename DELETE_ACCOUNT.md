# Delete Account Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive account deletion feature that permanently removes all user data from both the application database and Clerk authentication service. The feature includes proper validation, security measures, and user experience considerations.

## Implementation Details

### Delete Account API (`app/(api)/delete-account+api.ts`)

The delete account API handles the complete removal of user data from the database:

- **Comprehensive Data Deletion**: Removes data from all user-related tables
- **Proper Order**: Deletes data in the correct order to avoid foreign key constraints
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed logging
- **Security**: Validates user identity before deletion

### Database Tables Cleaned

The API deletes user data from the following tables in order:

1. **api_logs** - API usage logs
2. **deep_focus_sessions** - Focus session data
3. **activities** - Workout activities
4. **steps** - Step tracking data
5. **weights** - Weight tracking data
6. **meals** - Meal logs and nutrition data
7. **data_consent** - Data collection consent preferences
8. **privacy_consent** - Privacy policy consent
9. **users** - Main user profile and nutrition goals

### Account Settings Integration

The delete account feature is integrated into the Account Settings page with:

- **Password Validation**: For password-based users, requires current password verification
- **OAuth Support**: For OAuth users, no password required (handled by provider)
- **Confirmation Modal**: Clear warning about permanent deletion
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during deletion process
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery options

## Security Features

### Password Verification

For users with password-based authentication:

- Requires current password verification using Clerk's sign-in API
- Prevents unauthorized account deletion
- Validates password before proceeding with deletion

### OAuth User Handling

For OAuth-only users:

- No password verification required (handled by OAuth provider)
- Direct deletion with confirmation
- Clear messaging about the process

### Data Protection

- **Complete Removal**: All user data is permanently deleted
- **No Recovery**: Deletion is irreversible
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of deletion process
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial failures

## User Flow

### For Password-Based Users:

1. **Access**: User navigates to Account Settings → Delete Account
2. **Confirmation**: User sees warning about permanent deletion
3. **Password Entry**: User enters current password
4. **Validation**: System verifies password with Clerk
5. **Database Cleanup**: All user data is removed from database
6. **Clerk Deletion**: User account is deleted from Clerk
7. **Success**: User is signed out and redirected to sign-in

### For OAuth Users:

1. **Access**: User navigates to Account Settings → Delete Account
2. **Confirmation**: User sees warning about permanent deletion
3. **Direct Deletion**: No password required, proceed with deletion
4. **Database Cleanup**: All user data is removed from database
5. **Clerk Deletion**: User account is deleted from Clerk
6. **Success**: User is signed out and redirected to sign-in

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- **Password Incorrect**: Clear error message for password-based users
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of database connection issues
- **Clerk Errors**: Specific error messages for authentication service issues
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages
- **Partial Failures**: Rollback mechanisms and recovery options

## API Endpoint

### DELETE /(api)/delete-account

**Parameters:**

- `clerkId` (query parameter): The user's Clerk ID

**Response:**

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"message": "Account and all associated data deleted successfully",
	"deletedUser": 123
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
	"error": "Failed to delete account",
	"details": "Database connection failed"
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Account Settings Component

The delete account functionality is integrated into the existing Account Settings page:

- **Conditional UI**: Different interfaces for password vs OAuth users
- **Modal Design**: Consistent with app's design system
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during deletion process
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages and recovery options

### User Experience Features

- **Clear Warnings**: Prominent warnings about permanent deletion
- **Confirmation Steps**: Multiple confirmation steps to prevent accidental deletion
- **Progress Feedback**: Loading indicators and status messages
- **Graceful Exit**: Proper sign-out and navigation after deletion

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are included in `__tests__/deleteAccount.test.tsx` covering:

- **API Functionality**: Database deletion operations
- **Error Handling**: Various error scenarios
- **Parameter Validation**: Missing or invalid parameters
- **Success Cases**: Complete deletion workflows
- **Edge Cases**: Non-existent users and partial failures

## Privacy and Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

The delete account feature ensures GDPR compliance by:

- **Right to Erasure**: Complete removal of all personal data
- **No Data Retention**: No backup or archival of deleted data
- **Verification**: Proper user verification before deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Logging of deletion activities for compliance

### Data Protection

- **Complete Removal**: All user data is permanently deleted
- **No Recovery**: Deletion is irreversible and complete
- **Secure Process**: Password verification for sensitive operations
- **Logging**: Audit trail for compliance and debugging

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: Users must be authenticated to delete accounts
- **Password Verification**: Current password required for password-based users
- **Secure API**: All deletion operations go through secure API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the delete account feature:

1. **Soft Delete**: Option for temporary account deactivation
2. **Data Export**: Allow users to export their data before deletion
3. **Admin Override**: Administrative account deletion capabilities
4. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk account management
5. **Recovery Window**: Time-limited account recovery option

## Usage

### For Users:

1. Navigate to Account Settings
2. Tap "Delete Account" in the Account Actions section
3. Review the warning about permanent deletion
4. Enter your password (if applicable)
5. Confirm deletion
6. Wait for completion and automatic sign-out

### For Developers:

The delete account feature can be extended by:

- Adding new tables to the deletion process
- Implementing additional validation steps
- Adding admin override capabilities
- Creating data export functionality
- Implementing account recovery features

## Monitoring and Logging

The delete account process includes comprehensive logging:

- **Deletion Start**: Log when deletion process begins
- **Table Deletions**: Log each table deletion operation
- **Success/Failure**: Log completion status for each step
- **Error Details**: Detailed error logging for debugging
- **User Information**: Log user ID and deletion timestamp

This ensures proper monitoring and debugging capabilities for the account deletion process.
